 Bare-bones version of a unspecified monte carlo market simulation (FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY)
 *** more details to come ***

 (11/10/24) - Just a start. I have had this (sort of) idea in my head for a while now and because I had very little understanding of "real" programming when I started almost 5 years ago, 
              it's been an interesting journey of finding...well something that can (sort of) work using excel. You see, when I began this project, I understood the basics of the
              background math I want to implement, but now I'm confident in my ability to create an evaluable application concept. So, I'll be working on this scaled down version
              (when I can) going forward, and along the way I'll try to explain the reasoning behind the model's methods.
